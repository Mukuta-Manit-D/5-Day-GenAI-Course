Let me elaborate on it:\n\n**What is Generative AI for Molecule Design?**\n\nAt its core, generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can create new data that resembles the data it was trained on. In the context of drug discovery, this means AI models are being trained on vast datasets of known molecules, their chemical properties, and their biological interactions.\n\nOnce trained, these models can then:\n\n1.  **Generate entirely new molecular structures (De Novo Design):** Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, the AI can invent novel molecular blueprints that have never been synthesized before. It's like having an infinitely creative chemist who can draw up countless potential drug molecules.\n2.  **Design molecules with specific properties:** This is the truly powerful aspect. Researchers can set parameters for the AI, such as:\n    *   **Target Binding:** The molecule must effectively bind to a specific protein or receptor involved in a disease.\n    *   **Pharmacokinetic Properties (ADME):** The molecule should be absorbable, distributed throughout the body, metabolized at an appropriate rate, and excreted safely.\n    *   **Low Toxicity:** The molecule should avoid known toxic functional groups or predicted off-target interactions.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** The molecule should be chemically feasible to synthesize in a lab.\n    *   **Solubility:** It should dissolve well in the body.\n\n**How it Works (Simplified):**\n\nImagine you have a vast collection of LEGO bricks (representing atoms and chemical bonds). Generative AI models learn the \"rules\" of how these bricks can be put together to form stable and functional structures. They learn from successful LEGO structures (existing drugs) and unsuccessful ones (failed drug candidates or toxic compounds).\n\nThen, when you ask the AI to build a specific type of structure (a molecule that targets protein X and has certain properties), it uses its learned rules to construct one or more novel combinations of LEGO bricks that meet your criteria.\n\n**Key AI Architectures Used:**\n\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks: a \"generator\" that creates molecules and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish between real molecules and generated ones. They train each other, leading to increasingly realistic and useful molecules.\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecules and can then decode this representation to generate new ones.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used in conjunction with generative models to guide the molecule generation process towards specific desired properties, rewarding the AI for creating molecules that meet the criteria.\n*   **Transformer Models:** Increasingly, transformer architectures (similar to those used in natural language processing) are being adapted for molecular design, recognizing the sequential nature of chemical representations.\n\n**Why is this a Big Deal?**\n\n*   **Vastly Expands the Search Space:** The number of possible molecules is astronomically large. Generative AI allows us to explore this chemical universe far beyond what human intuition or brute-force screening could achieve.\n*   **Faster and More Efficient Design:** Instead of years of trial and error, AI can generate and propose optimized molecules in days or weeks, dramatically shortening the early stages of drug discovery.\n*   **Tackling \"Undruggable\" Targets:** Generative AI can design novel molecular scaffolds or approaches that might be able to bind to targets that were previously considered impossible to drug.\n*   **Personalized Medicine Potential:** In the future, generative AI could potentially design bespoke molecules tailored to an individual patient's specific genetic makeup or disease profile.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nCompanies like Insilico Medicine have been pioneers in this space, using their generative AI platform to design novel drug candidates for conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which have then advanced into clinical trials. Other companies are using similar approaches for oncology, neuroscience, and infectious diseases.\n\nIn essence, generative AI is moving drug discovery from a process of finding needles in haystacks to one where we can design the ideal needle for a specific lock. It's a paradigm shift that promises to accelerate the development of new medicines for unmet medical needs.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several companies, ranging from large pharmaceutical giants to agile biotech startups, are heavily invested in and actively developing generative AI for molecule design.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
